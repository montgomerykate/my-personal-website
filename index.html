    <h1>Ever wanted to plan a road trip and didnt know where to start?</h1>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
    <h2>Well, you're in luck because I love road tripping and have very few other hobbies</h2>
    <p>About 2 years ago, my best friend and I, feeling trapped in where we were with very little direction in our lives decided to go on a road trip.</p>
    <p>Although it was quite the impulsive decisionand we were definetly not as prepared as we should have been, we managed and we learned so much about things we wouldnthave thought of in our wildest dreams.</p>
    <p>We managed to drive from SE Michigan, to the west coast, down to the american south west, and all the way back to the east coast before returning home after 20 whole days on the road</p>

    <p>So, if you're intrested in learning how to hit the road, go ahead and read through for everything from budgeting, to transportation, to how to get the best photos!</p>
    <h3>Step 1: Time and Money</h3>
    <p>Road tripping is by far, one of the most cost effective ways to see and experience so many places in succession with one another. And the very best starting spot for finding out what you can and cannot do is to simply knowing how much time you have and how much money you're willing to spend. </p>
    <p>Start by picking your days, whether you want to go for 5 days or 3 months, having a time frame for everything you want to do is detrimental to everything. For the sake of the example, I'm just going to say the trip will be 2 weeks.</p>
    <p>Another very important item is insuring that you set your budget and make sure that when you're doing the math to add up expenses you are shooting high! It's better to come home under budget than spending hundreds more than you thought you would!! (Also, again, for the sake of example, I will be setting the budget to $2,000</p>
    <p>Google is your best friend! Want to check gas prices across the country? Google it. Find cool things to do you've never heard of? Google. Hotels? Park information? Campsites? Rental cars? Free camping?? All Google!!</p>
    <p>I find that the best way to organze expenses and to help budget properly is to make a table. A very smart way to save money on the road is to buy loads of foods that dont need to be refridgerated and can be easily accessed while driving. This also will allow you more driving time and in turn allow you to see more!</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Name</th>
                <th>Cost of expense</th>
                <th>Left in budget</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Gas</th>
                <th>$400</th>
                <th>$1,600</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Hotels/Camping</th>
                <th>$500</th>
                <th>1,100</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Souvineers</th>
                <th>$250</th>
                <th>$850</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Food</th>
                <th>$400</th>
                <th>$450</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Passes and parking</th>
                <th>$150</th>
                <th>$300</th>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>Notice how there is money left over in the innital budget? Thats there for a reason. Sometimes emergencies happen and you might have to pay to replace a tire, or might cut your hand and need stitches. Things happen so it's always good to be prepared for the worst. The road trip motto should always be "prepare for the worst and hope for the best" just so you have all of your bases covered.</p>
        <h3>Step 2: Mapping your route.</h3>
        <p>As much as I emphasized it in the previous section, Google is your best friend! Find a ton os places you want to go and print yourself out a map and make marks of all the places your want to go. Having the visual of all the places and their distance from one another can really help with planning and making decisions on extra places to go or certain places to cut out of the trip to save for next time!</p>
        <h3>Step 3: Find what kind of road tripping experiences you want.</h3>
        <p>Do you want to see cities or nature? Hot or cold climates? Luxury? Or roughing it? Van life or SUV? There is simply, no wrong way to road trip. In this section I'm going to do my best to include information to sites and services to set you in the right direction to find how you want to cater your experience.</p>
        <p>Van Life: don't have the time, resousrces or money to convert your own van? Or do you just want to give van life a try before you buy? There is an incredible service called <a href="https://www.escapecampervans.com/?utm_term=escape%20campervans&utm_campaign=Brand&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=4135558672&hsa_cam=844505712&hsa_grp=41981366774&hsa_ad=587520340712&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-307478962737&hsa_kw=escape%20campervans&hsa_mt=e&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=CjwKCAjwloCSBhAeEiwA3hVo_SUOa857bNbY8owATNpbeCJL_A_d81754kVPO-BdQvBb4WyE4xmKTRoCsBgQAvD_BwE">Escape Campervans</a> that does just that. They have locations all around the U.S. and Canada and have multiole options to choose from to make your experince the best for you. That all being said, something like a campervan would be great to reduce prices of hotels and general lodging and you can van camp anywhere on <a href="https://www.blm.gov/programs/recreation/camping">this site</a> for free!</p>
        <p>Hotels: read the fine print and make sure you triple check locations in order to stay safe! Another great pointer is to book on the hotels actual website instead of through third party services (such as booking.com or expedia) since they do NOT have have first priority in room availability.</p>
        <p>Parks: If you even consider going to 3 or more national parks, I would HIGHLY recommend <a href="https://www.myscenicdrives.com/store/item/forest-passes/america-the-beautiful?gclid=CjwKCAjwloCSBhAeEiwA3hVo_bDlW1XKqsYXh7cxEj4rjEkD7wKMmoV7-ElVSDXtAkUv5GGFLjDUfRoCfzMQAvD_BwE">purchasing an annual national park pass</a> they are good for an entire year and will get you in to virtually every park without fee! Not only a great way to save money, but a great way to support the NPS!</p>
        <h3>How to get the best photos.</h3>
        <p>This piece of advice is so simple its crazy. All you need to do if use your panorama setting on your phones camera. Panoramas allow you to long expose scenery and get a much clearer and deeper photo with more dimension (all examples below are my own images)</p>
        <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AM-JKLV1WUdxMkUMn1iJvtbYjMgkCr9cEvrCsFnIX6xvGw0Ev0_xPV7d89WUQgYzcq7jfMBNt47WeNCjlK5uj9L0lC5gxV1UoL283UCQhmbTbthAunitkdaVoM2Dx8zVepTXBL7bpUHTZulHlgYBV4gMhU5uuA=w1286-h323-no?authuser=1" alt="the coastal redwood forest">

        <p>And thats it for now! Theres so much that goes in to planning a road trip that it can be really scary not knowing where to start and it can also be sad when you realize that you might have to say no to things you really wanted to do because it might not be within reason for one particular trip.</p>
